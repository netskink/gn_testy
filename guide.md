## Notes

* mailing list

* [git](https://gn.googlesource.com)
* [consolidated help](./gn/docs/reference.md)
	- above link assumes you have git cloned gn in this repo

### gn and ninja files

gn will generate the initial ninja files.

Assuming the current directory has the following files:

* .gn
* BUILD.gn

This command sequence:

```
$ gn gen -C out
```

Will make an out dir.  In this dir will be the following files:

* args.gn
* build.ninja
* build.ninja.d
* build.ninja.stamp
* toolchain.ninja
* obj/ dir

For example three (mine3) obj/ dir will contain the following files:

* main.ninja
	- the exe 
* mymath.ninja
	- the static library (*.a)
* mystring.ninja
	- the dynamic/shared libray (*.so)

### gn and regenerating ninja files

Once you have run the `gn gen` command you do not need
to rerun `gn` explicitly even if you have modified the `BUILD.gn`
file.

The ninja files generated by ninja will automatically rerun ninja.  Here
is an example:

Generate the ninja files.

```
$ gn gen -C out
Done. Made 3 targets from 4 files in 7ms
```

Build the code using ninja

```
$ ninja -v -C out
ninja: Entering directory `out'
[1/6] g++ -MMD -MF obj/src/main.main.o.d     -c ../src/main.cc -o obj/src/main.main.o
[2/6] g++ -MMD -MF obj/src/libmymath.MyMath.o.d     -c ../src/MyMath.cc -o obj/src/libmymath.MyMath.o
[3/6] g++ -MMD -MF obj/src/libmystring.MyString.o.d -DMYSTRING_IMPLEMENTATION    -c ../src/MyString.cc -o obj/src/libmystring.MyString.o
[4/6] ar rcs obj/libmymath.a obj/src/libmymath.MyMath.o
[5/6] g++ -shared  -o ./libmystring.so -install_name @executable_path/./libmystring.so @libmystring.so.rsp
[6/6] g++  -o main @main.rsp  
```

Touch the original `BUILD.gn` file, rerun `ninja` and see how it reruns `gn.`

```
$ touch BUILD.gn 
$ ninja -v -C out
ninja: Entering directory `out'
[0/1] ../../../gn/out/gn --root=./.. -q --C --regeneration gen .
ninja: no work to do.
$
```

### Summary Usage

```
# usage: build

```
$ gn gen -C out
$ ninja -v -C out
$ ./out/main
```

# usage: clean 

Clean build from ninja.

```
$ ninja -v -C out -t clean
```

Clean ninja files generated by gn.

```
$ gn clean out
```

### Important Files

* .gn
	```
	# The location of the build configuration file.
    buildconfig = "//build/BUILDCONFIG.gn"
	```
	- This file identifies the top level of the gn/ninja build system.  You can override with `--root-/somedir` command line argument.
	- The contents of this file specifies the `build` dir containing the configs file.
		- Once `gn gen` is run:
		- build/BUILD.gn
			- contains configs used by build/toolchain/BUILD.gn
		- build/BUILDCONFIG.gn
			- Variables in this file are global to all build files.
			- Variables for default toolchain
			- Variables for compiler flags and settings
		- build/toolchain/BUILD.gn
			- contains tool definitions
			- cc, cxx, alink, solink, etc.

	- 
	- see `gn help dotfile`
* BUILD.gn
	- Contains the list of target directives.
		- executable
		- shared_library
		- static_library
		- source_set
		- etc.
	- Also contains the list of config directives
	- Sets up global variables and default settings
	- Location defined by `.gn` file

#### `.gn` content

This file contains a list of variables.  See `gn help dotfile` for a complete list.  Here is a subset of variables:

* `buildconfig`
	- required variable.
	- Contains path to a file containing the default `args.gn` content.  This content is visible when you run:
	```
	$ cd mine3
	$ gn args -C out
	# or
	# gn args out
	```
	It will open the `out/args.gn` file where you can edit the default args.
	- Can also list the default args via:
	```
	$ gn args out --list --short
	current_cpu = ""
	current_os = ""
	host_cpu = "arm64"
	host_os = "mac"
	target_cpu = ""
	target_os = ""
	```
	- Note in this case, `out/args.gn` is empty and thus these args are via other files.  Namely, `build/BUILDCONFIG.gn`
	- see `gn help args`
* `root`
	- optional variable
	- Label of the root build target.
	- `gn` will start by loading the build file containing this target name.  Defaults to "//:" which causes gn to load `//BUILD.gn`.
	- The command-line switch `--root-target` will override this target.  See `gn help --root-target`.


### Important Commands

* `gn help`
	- `gn help runtime_deps`
	- `gn help deps`
	- `gn help data`
* `gn clean out`
	- This cleans out the results of the ninja build. ie. *.o, *.a, *.so, etc.
	- It does not clean out/*.gn files.
* `gn ls <build_dir> <target_wildcard>`
	- Lists all the targets
	- `gn ls out/ "//*"`
		* `//:main`
		* `//:mymath`
		* `//:mystring`
* `gn desc <build_dir> <target_name>`
	- Describes target for example provides
		* sources
		* Type of target. eg. executable, shared library or static library.
		* direct dependencies
	- `gn desc out/ "//:main"`
	- `gn desc out //:main runtime_deps`
	- `gn desc out //:main deps`
	- `gn desc out //:main deps --tree`

* `gn desc <build_dir> <target_name> deps --tree`
	- `gn desc out //:main deps --tree`
    - lists depends tree
	- `gn desc out/ "//:main"` deps --tree
* `gn args out`
    - opens an editor to override the default
* `gn args --list out`
    - shows all the args, default values and their documentation
* `gn analyze <out_dir> <input_path> <output_path>`
	- analyze which targets are affected by a list of files
	- If the input/output paths are `-`, then it
	uses stdin/stdout.
	- While helpfull, this is a bit tricky to use.
	- Here is a sample in.json
	```
	{
		"files":[
			"//src/xmain.cc",
			"//src/xMyString.cc",
			"//src/xMyMath.cc"
		],
		"test_targets":[
			"//:mystring"
		]
	}
	```
	- In this case, I want to find if the specified files are required to build the `mystring` library.  Since these are typos of the various
	source files, the analyze will say there is no dependency.
	```
	$ gn analyze out in.json  -
	{"compile_targets":[],"status":"No dependency","test_targets":[]}
	```
	- If the sample json file is corrected to have
	the proper filenames, then the output is:
	```
	$ gn analyze out in.json  -
	{"compile_targets":[],"status":"Found dependency","test_targets":["//:mystring"]}
	```
* `gn outputs <out_dir> <list of target or file names>`
	- 


### Important Target Declarations

These are common target declarations used in `BUILD.gn`

NOTE: Targets chain dependecies on other targets using the `deps` directive.

* executable
	- Declare an executable target
	- Tools and commands used to create this target are determined by the source files in its sources.
	- C/C++ are allowed, but C and Rust are not.
* shared_library
	- Declare a shared library target
	- makes a `.so` file.
	- A shared library will be specified on the linker line for targets listing the shared library in it its "deps".
	- On osx use "loadable_module" instead.
* static_library
	- Declare a static library target
	- makes a `.a` or a `.lib` file.
	- If you want to skip the `.a`, but want intermediate results consider a `source set` instead.
* group
	- Declare a named group of targets
	- This target type creates meta-targets that just collect a set of dependencies into one named target.  
	- Groups can additionally specify configs that apply to their dependents.
	- Example
	```
	group("all") {
		deps = [
		"//project:runner",
		"//project:unit_tests",
		]   
  	}
	```
* loadable_module
	- Declare a loadable module target
	- Creates an object file that is (and can only be) loaded and unloaded at runtime.
	- If you don't want this (if you don't need to dynamically load the library at runtime), then you should use a "shared_library" target type instead.  (What?)
	- The style guide has more info on this relative to plaforms linux, windows and osx.  See [here](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/+/main/docs/style_guide.md#loadable-modules-versus-shared-libraries)
* target
	- Declare a target with specified programmatic type
	- The target() function is a way to invoke a built-in target or template with a type determined at runtime.  This is useful for cases where the type of a target type might not be known statically.
	- Only templates and built-in target functions are supported for the target type string parameter.  Arbitrary functions, configs and toolchains are not supported.
	- signature:
	```
	target(target_type string, target_name string) { ... }
	```
	- Equvalent Example
	```
	target("source_set", "doom_melon") {...}
	```
	=
	```
	source_set("doom_melon") {...}
	```
### Important Target Variables

* compiler configuration settings
	* include_dirs
		- When a subdir contains a library which is specified as a dependency, the subdir does not appear to be included.  In this case, specify this option to locate the headers.  See example `mine4`.
		```
		include_dirs = [ "//src/mymath" ]
		```
	* cflags
		- Flags for the compiler
		```
		cflags = [ "-Wall" ]
		```
	* defines
		- Preprocessor defines to steer `#ifdef`s
		```
		defines = [ "FOO=BAR" ]
		```
	* config
		- Can group all configs for reuse in multiple targets
		```
		config("myconfig") {
			include_dirs = [ "//src/mymath" ]
			cflags = [ "-Wall" ]
			defines = [ "FOO=BAR" ]
		}
		```





### Important config directives
Used in the BUILD.gn files.  

* example

```
config("myconfig") {
	include_dirs = [ "include/common" ]
	defines = [ "ENABLE_DOOM_MELON" ]
}

executable("mything") {
	configs = [ ":myconfig" ]
}
```


### gn clean and ninja clean

1. gn gen makes the build dir and the ninja build files.
2. then use ninja to build the projet

When you run `ninja -t clean`, it cleans the files that ninja knows about.  When you run `gn clean` it deletes everything.  Note, if you touch the gn config files, the ninja files generated by gn will auto-re-run gn to recreate the ninja files.


### Targets, Dependencies and Labels

Using the `src/mine3/BUILD.gn` file as an example, which is reproduced here for quick reference.

```
executable("main") {
  sources = [ 
    "src/main.cc" 
  ]

# this connects the executable to the two
# library targets
  deps = [
    ":mymath",  # shorthand notation
    "//:mystring" # explicit long hand notation
  ]
}

# this makes a static library
# libmymath.a file
static_library("mymath") {
  sources = [ 
    "src/MyMath.cc",
    "src/MyMath.h" 
  ]
}

# this makes a dynamic library
# libmystring.so file
shared_library("mystring") {
  sources = [ 
    "src/MyString.cc",
    "src/MyString.h" 
  ]

  defines = [ "MYSTRING_IMPLEMENTATION"]
}
```

The words, "main", "mymath", etc in the target directives are termed `labels`.  The ":" is a shorthand method.  The full name is specified using a `"\\"` syntax to signify the top level directory with interleaving `"\"` to denote sub-directories.

If the source was in a sub-directory then the "\" would comes into play.


Regarding dependencies.  It appears that specifying a dependency on a target in 
a subdir does not add that subdir to the list of includes.  This is demonstrasted in
examples `mine4` and onward.  Without the `include_dirs` directive, `gn gen` will work, but
the compile via `ninja -C out` will fail because it can not locate the header files.


#### From the Brett Wilson presentation

##### Full Label

```
//chrome/browser:version
```

Looks for "version" in `chrome/browser/BUILD.gn`

##### Implicit name

```
//base
```

Shorthand for `//base:base`

##### In Current file

```
:baz
```

Shorthand for `baz` in current file.

```
//:baz
```

Specifies a label (baz) in top level.  Useful for a BUILD.gn in a subdir.

```
//foo:bar
```

Specifies a label (bar) in a subdir named foo.

Example src/mine7 demos usage of configs and labels.
